# Obsidian Caesar

## Why

Maybe you just want to hide your "notes" from "some people", but at the same
time you don't want to really encrypt them, want to exchange the files easily
without the weird look of encrypted files, or want to be able decipher the text
with pen and paper later. The possibilities are endless.

## How
1. Select text
2. Open command palette <Ctrl+p>
3. Write cipher/decipher
4. Enter shift value (***memorize it***)
5. ...
6. *Profit!!!*
